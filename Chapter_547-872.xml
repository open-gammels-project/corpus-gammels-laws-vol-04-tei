In consideration of such improvement of the bar, the company may demand and receive, for its own use, tonnage duties at the rate of ten cents a ton on all vessels crossing said bar, of classes which would draw more than eight feet of water, if fully freighted; and the right to collect such duties shall commence when the company shall have improved said bar to the depth of nine feet as aforesaid, and shall continue during the continuance of such im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />provement, and to the end of ten years from the time allowed as aforesaid, for that degree of improvement, and for five years more for each additional foot of depth of said bar, caused by said com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany, within the term of ten years aforesaid; provided, such right of collecting tonnage duties shall be discontinued whenever the United States, or this State, shall undertake, by actual work, to improve said bar to a depth greater than that intended and at<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tainable by any work of the company then in progress of execution, and whenever the fair cost of the company&#8217;s improvement of said bar shall have been refunded in cash by other means than said duties, which shall be instead of interest.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The company for any of its improvements shall have right of way and of stations, according to the charter, on any pub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lic lands, whether covered by water or not, and right of property in any flats, shallows, reefs and islands connected with or near to any of said roads, between the main land and the main gulf, inclu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sive of the large islands bordering the latter; and for any such road, other than a railroad, in a bay, the company may acquire such lands by location, survey and patent, on any valid land claim, in the usual mode, within the distance of one mile from such road, and in case any such road shall be a good and substantial railroad with suita<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ble iron rails, the company may acquire such lands by survey and patent, without any other claim within the distance of two miles from such railroad, within the bay.</p>
<p>And within a bay, where there may be doubt of the district to which the lands belong, they may be surveyed for any of the pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />poses aforesaid by the surveyor of any district adjacent to the bay.</p>
<p>And the roads aforesaid, within a bay, shall be part of <pb n="788" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="242" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>the system of improvements of the company, which shall have on these roads similar fates of charges to those provided in the original charter for a turnpike or railroad respectively.</p>
<p>Provided, that no drawbridge shall be constructed across the ship channel now existing, or which may hereafter be constructed between Corpus Christi and Aransas pass; provided also, that a certain island known as the &#8220;shell bank,&#8221; situate at the eastern ter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />minus of Corpus Christi Bayou, shall not be subject to location or occupancy under the provisions of this act; and further provided, that the rights herein granted shall not interfere with any right granted to any other person, natural or civil; and provided further, that said company shall have a majority of its directors resident in this State, and shall hold all its elections for directors and other officers within this State; and after the first of the year eighteen hundred and sixty, shall keep its principal office at one of its road stations.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The company may change the location of any of its im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />provements, as it may deem best, to any distance within five miles of the original location, subject to the same terms; but the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany&#39;s system of roads shall be restricted to the roads aforesaid within a bay, and extend to any part of the town at the coast ter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />minus, and to the principal turnpike from Goliad to the coast ter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />minus, and a branch therefrom to a point on the Rio Grande river, at or near to Cariso; subject to any right that now exists or may hereafter be granted to the city of Corpus Christi, or other authority, to improve the Corpus Christi reef; and the right to make the prin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cipal Turnpike aforesaid from Goliad to the coast terminus, shall terminate with the year eighteen hundred and fifty-eight, and the right to make the branch aforesaid, shall terminate with the year eighteen hundred and sixty; and the company shall not have the right of changing either said principal turnpike or said branch into a railroad, under the original charter, and the acceptance of this supplement by said company shall be a relinquishment of all right to make roads or to obtain lands therefor under the original char<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ter or this supplement, except as herein specified.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. in view of the modified provisions of the charter of said company, its capital stock shall be one million of dollars in value, of cash and other property; of which the property here<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tofore acquired by the company, shall constitute a part, and the company shall own in cash or its equivalent in <pb n="789" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="243" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>other property in value, at least five per cent of said capital stock, before proceeding otherwise to avail (itself) of the provisions of this supplement.</p>
