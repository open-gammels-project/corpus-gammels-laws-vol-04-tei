<p>1st, Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That this State regards the act of Congress passed in 1850, admitting Cali<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fornia into the Union, fixing the boundary of Texas, establishing ter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ritorial governments in Utah and New Mexico, composing a part of what is commonly called the compromise measures of 1850, as questions fully settled, so far as they have relation to the question of slavery, and that Texas is opposed to any change in those laws effecting (affecting) their principles on the great questions which have unhappily divided the Northern and Southern States of the Union.</p>
<pb n="264" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="84" /><fw type="header" place="top">Joint Resolutions.</fw>
<p>2d, Resolved, That the State of Texas regards the remaining act of the compromise measures of 1850, commonly called the fugitive slave law, as a measure of constitutional right and justice to the slave-holding States, essential to their peace and the preservation of their rights, and that she would look upon the repeal or modifica<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of that act, as an invasion of her constitutional rights, and a just cause of alarm to herself and her sister States of the South.</p>
<p>3d, Resolved, That the State of Texas regards the late act of the United States Congress known as the Kansas Nebraska act, whereby those territories are thrown open to settlement alike by citizens from the slave holding and non-slaveholding States, as a measure founded in the true spirit of the Federal Constitution of justice to all parts of the Union, and of vital importance to the Southern States of the confederacy, as well as the permanent peace of the Nation; and while this State utterly opposes the repeal of that law, or any modification of its provisions effecting (affecting) the immigration or rights of slave holders in said territories, she, in common with her sister States of the South, would regard such repeal or modification as an invasion of the true spirit of the Constitution of the United States, as sectional in its character, and as a just cause of alarm on the part of the slave holding States. That the Governor cause copies of this resolution to be forwarded to each of our Senators and Representa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tives in the Congress of the United States, duly authenticated.</p>
