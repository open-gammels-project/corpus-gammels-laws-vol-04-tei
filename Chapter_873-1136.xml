<salute>Rules applicable to offences against the person when committed by Slaves or Free Persons of color.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Article 802 shall hereafter read as follows:</p>
<p>The offences enumerated in Title 17 of the Second Part of this Code, when committed by slaves or free persons of color, against a free white person, are subject to different rules from such as are prescribed in defining such offences when committed by a free white person, and the guilt or innocence of the accussed is to be ascer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tained by a consideration of the following general principles:</p>
<p>1st. The right of the master to the obedience and submission of his slave, in all lawful things, is perfect, and the power belongs to the master to inflict any punishment upon the slave not affecting life or limb, and not coining within the definition of cruel treat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment, or unreasonable abuse, which he may consider necessary for the purpose of keeping him in such submission, and enforcing such submission to his commands; and if, in the exercise of this right, with or without cause, the slave resists and slays his master, it is murder.</p>
<pb n="1059" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="187" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>
<p>2d. The master has not the right to kill his slave, or to maim or dismember him, except in cases mentioned in article 564 of this Code.</p>
<p>3d. A master, in the exercise of his right to perfect obedience on the part of the slave, may correct in moderation, and is the ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />clusive judge of the necessity of such correction; and resistance by the slave, under such circumstances, if it results in homicide, ren<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ders him guilty of murder.</p>
<p>4th. The insolence of a slave will justify a white man in inflict<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing moderate chastisement, with an ordinary instrument of correc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, if done at the time when the insolent language is used, or within a reasonable time after; but it will not authorize an excessive battery, as with a dangerous weapon.</p>
<p>5th. The rules respecting manslaughter, as given in the second part of this Code, apply only to equals, and not to the case of of<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fences by slaves, or free persons of color, against free white persons.</p>
<p>6th. An assault and battery, not inflicting great injury, com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted by a free white person upon a slave, will not be a sufficient provocation to mitigate a homicide of the former by the latter, from murder to manslaughter, although it be in a case where the law does not expressly justify such assault and battery.</p>
<p>7th. That amount of personal injury is a legal provocation, of which it can be pronounced, having due regard to the relative con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dition of the white man and slave, and the obligation of the latter to conform his passions to his condition of inferiority, that it would provoke well disposed slaves into a violent passion, and the exist<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ence of such provocation will reduce the homicide to manslaughter.</p>
<p>8th. If a slave, by insolence, provoke chastisement, and then slay the person chastising him, it will be murder.</p>
<p>9th. In the following cases it is lawing for a free white person to inflict chastisement upon a slave by moderate whipping:</p>
<p>1st. If a slave, without the consent of the white person, be found upon his premises at night.</p>
<p>2d. If the slave, against the orders of the white person, be found upon his premises at any time.</p>
<p>3d. If a slave be found using improper language, or guilty of in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />decent or turbulent conduct in the presence of white persons.</p>
<pb n="1060" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="188" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>
<p>4th. If the slave be guilty of rude or unbecoming conduct in the presence of a free white female.</p>
<p>5th. If a slave use insulting language or gestures towards a white person.</p>
<p>6th. If a slave commit any wilfull act, injurious to the property or person of a free white person, or of any member of his family.</p>
<p>7th. If a slave be found drunk, and making a disturbance in any public place, or upon the premises of a free white person.</p>
