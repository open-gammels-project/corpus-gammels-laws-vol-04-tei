</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That the sixth section of an act entitled &#8220;an act regula<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ting sequestrations,&#8221; approved March 15th, 1848, is hereby amended so that the same shall hereafter read as follows, to-wit: That hereafter any defendant whose property has been taken by writ of sequestration, shall have the right to retain the same by delivering to the Sheriff, or other officer executing such writ, his bond, payable to the plaintiff, with good and sufficient sureties, to be approved by the Sheriff or officer taking the same, for an amount of money equal to double the value of the prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty sequestered, which bond, if the property sequestered be <pb n="1433" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="71" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>slaves or movable property, shall be conditioned that the defend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ant will not send away the same out of the county or limits of the State, according to the plaintiff&#8217;s affidavit; that he will not make an improper use of the same, and that he will have such slaves or movable property, with the value of the hire, fruits or revenue there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />of, forthcoming to abide the decision of the Court, or that he will pay the value thereof, and of the hire, fruits or revenue, in case the suit shall be decided against him. If the property se<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />questered be real property, the condition of said bond shall be that the defendant will not injure such property, and that he will pay the value of the rents of the same, in case he shall be condemned so to do. Such bond shall be returned to the Court with the writ, and in ease the suit is decided against the defendant, final judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment shall be entered against all obligors in such bond, jointly and severally. Provided, that nothing in this section shall be so con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />strued as to require a defendant to account for the hire, fruits or revenues of slaves or movable property, or for the rents of real property, when the object of the suit is only to enforce the pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of a mortgage or lien, and not to try title thereto.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The seventh section of said recited act is hereby amend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ed so that the same shall hereafter read as follows, to-wit: The sheriff, or other officer, while he retains the custody of the sequest<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ered property, shall take care and manage the same in a prudent manner; he may confide the same to the custody of other persons, but he shall be responsible, for their acts and shall be responsible to the party injured, for any neglect or mismanagement by himself or by those to whom he has confided the custody or management of such property; and he shall be entitled to receive a just compensa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion and all reasonable charges therefor, to be determined by the Court or Justice of the Peace having jurisdiction of the cause, and paid out of the proceeds of the property sequestered, if judgment be given in favor of the party suing out the writ of sequestration; but if judgment be against the party suing out said writ, then such compensation and reasonable charges shall be paid by him. If the defendant does not replevy the property sequestered, within thirty days after seizure thereof, the Sheriff or other officer shall de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />liver the property to the plaintiff, upon his giving bond, payable to the Sheriff or other officer, in a sum at least double the value of the property sequestered, with two or more good and sufficient sureties to be approved by the officer, conditioned that the prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty together with the value of the hire, fruits or revenue thereof, shall be forthcoming to abide the decision of the Court; which <pb n="1434" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="72" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>bond, if forfeited, or if the suit be decided against the plaintiff, shall have the force and effect of a judgment against all the obligors therein, in favor of the defendant. If the property se<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />questered be slaves, and the defendant does not replevy the same within thirty days from the seizure thereof, or the plaintiff within ten days after the expiration of said thirty days, it shall be the duty of the Sheriff or other officer to hire out said slaves to the best advantage.</p>
